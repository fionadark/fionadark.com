            Software Engineer | Computer Science Graduate from Fordham University | Passionate About Tech Innovation &
            Diversity in STEM
        </p>
        <p>
            I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science from Fordham University, where I also minored in
            Anthropology. This summer I completed a Software Engineering internship at Arity, where I engineered
            high-volume data pipelines and backend services in cloud-native environments, contributing to scalable,
            real-time applications that make transportation technology smarter, safer, and more useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my academic and professional experience, I’ve developed proficiency in programming languages such
            as Java, C++, Python, and Swift, along with hands-on experience in full-stack development, data modeling,
            and software testing. At the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, I designed an efficient SQL data model
            for a national climate change database and led the development of a website prototype that helped secure
            $30,000 in funding. I’ve also built independent projects, including Augur, a Java-based Tarot card reading
            application that integrates REST APIs and unit testing to ensure reliability and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>
            My studies in cultural anthropology have enhanced my communication, research, and data analysis skills, and
            have strengthened my commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. I’m passionate
            about using my technical skills to build products that not only innovate but also consider diverse
            perspectives and needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now seeking new opportunities to grow as a software engineer, where I can apply my skills to build
            innovative, user-focused products. I’m always open to connecting with others in the tech community, so feel
            free to reach out to me at fionadark@protonmail.com. or visit my GitHub at https://github.com/fionadark.
